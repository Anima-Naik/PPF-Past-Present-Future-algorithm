Past present future (PPF) is a new stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the phenomena of the way an individual learns from a successful person in society.This algorithm is easy to understand and also to implement.
The code is based on the following papers. A. Naik,S.C. Satapathy,Past present future: a new human-based algorithm for stochastic optimization.Soft Comput 25, 12915â€“12976 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06229-8
